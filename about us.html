        1.🩹 Acetaminophen (Pain Reliever /
        Antipyretic) This is a pain reliever and fever reducer, but it does not
        reduce inflammation. Active Ingredient: Acetaminophen (or Paracetamol in
        many countries). Common Brand Names: Tylenol, Panadol. How it works: Its
        exact mechanism for pain relief is not fully understood, but it is
        effective for mild to moderate headaches, including tension headaches.
        Safety Note: The maximum daily dose is critical. Exceeding 3,000 mg to
        4,000 mg (depending on the product/doctor's advice) in 24 hours can
        cause severe, potentially fatal, liver damage. Be careful when taking
        combination cold and flu medicines that also contain acetaminophen. <br>
        2. 🛡
        Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs work by blocking
        the body's production of chemicals (prostaglandins) that cause pain and
        inflammation. They are effective for pain, fever, and inflammation,
        making them a good choice for headaches and migraines. Ibuprofen Common
        Brand Names: Advil, Motrin IB. How it works: Reduces pain and tackles
        any underlying inflammation contributing to the headache. It tends to
        work quickly. Safety Note: Should generally be taken with food or milk
        to reduce the risk of stomach irritation and potential gastrointestinal
        bleeding. Naproxen Sodium Common Brand Names: Aleve. How it works:
        Similar to Ibuprofen, but it is longer-acting, meaning you typically
        don't have to take it as frequently. Safety Note: Also an NSAID; carries
        a risk of stomach irritation and should be taken with food. Aspirin
        (Acetylsalicylic Acid) Common Brand Names: Bayer.
